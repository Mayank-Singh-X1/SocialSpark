## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#29ABE2) for a professional yet approachable feel.
- Background color: Light blue (#E5F5FF) providing a clean, airy backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF8C00) to highlight key CTAs and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font suitable for both headlines and body text, will convey a modern, neutral look.
- Use a set of minimalist, consistent icons that align with the chosen font to reinforce clarity and modernity. Icons should be related to social media, content creation, and sharing.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with generous spacing to ensure readability and ease of use. The generator page should feature a clear separation between input form and live preview.
- Implement subtle animations, such as a loading skeleton when generating new posts, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
